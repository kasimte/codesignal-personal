Note: Try to solve this task in O(list size) time using O(1) additional space, since this is what you'll be asked during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers l and a non-negative integer n, move the last n list nodes to the beginning of the linked list.

Example

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 3, the output should be
rearrangeLastN(l, n) = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and n = 1, the output should be
rearrangeLastN(l, n) = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] linkedlist.integer l

A singly linked list of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ list size ≤ 105,
-1000 ≤ element value ≤ 1000.

[input] integer n

A non-negative integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ n ≤ list size.

[output] linkedlist.integer

Return l with the n last elements moved to the beginning.
